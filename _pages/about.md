## About Me
I am a *Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Human Factors and Ergonomics* at the School of Design and Creative Arts, Loughborough University, UK. 
<br><br>
My research focuses on <span style="color: #9d4edd"> human factors in future mobility </span>, including passenger comfort in highly automated driving, human-automated vehicle interaction, inclusive design for diverse users, and active travel. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding human behaviour and designing better systems for their <span style="color: #9d4edd">interaction with technology</span> 🚘 🤖 🚲.
<br><br>
👩‍🎓 I received my *PhD* from *University of Leeds*, UK, as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow (2024). Before that, I obtained my *BEng in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engingeering* from the *University of Electronic Science and Technology of China* (2017) and *MSc in Human Technology Interaction* from *Eindhoven University of Technology*, The Netherlands (2019).
